# SilverBullet plug for showing a graph view of the documents

This plug aims to bring similar functionality as the Obsidian Graph view to
Silver Bullet.

This repo is a fork of
[Bertjan Broeksema's original repo](https://github.com/bbroeksema/silverbullet-graphview)

## Installation

Open (`cmd+k`) your `PLUGS` note (v1) or `CONFIG` note (v2) as appropriate (Refer to Silverbullet docs)
in SilverBullet and add this plug to the list.

* Stable version for Silverbullet v1:
```yaml
- ghr:deepkn/silverbullet-graphview/1.0.1
```

* Stable version for Silverbullet v2:
```yaml
- ghr:deepkn/silverbullet-graphview
```

* Development version (only for testing, edge and works with only Silverbullet v2):
```yaml
- github:deepkn/silverbullet-graphview/graphview.plug.js
```

Then run the `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!

**Note**: A version for v1 exists, but new development will most likely stick to
edge and therefore v2.

## Usage

Run the `Show Global Graph` command to open up the global graph view - global graph is
your entire space visualized as the graph.

Run the `Show Local Graph` command to open up the local graph view - local graph is
your current page and it's immediate links, with an option to expand the graph one
level at a time.

Zoom and pan is supported by scroll and pinch gestures with the mouse(pad).

### Tags & Paths

Use `ignoredPrefixes` to omit entire path prefixes from being displayed in the
graph.

Set tags on the pages to customize their appearance in the graph

- `#node_color=ff0000` â†’ Change node color to red
- `#graphignore` â†’ Hide the page from the graph

You can also use other custom tags to define node colors: Create a colormap with
HEX-colorcodes in `SETTINGS.md`. In this example, a node of a page where the tag
`#garden` is set will be rendered as green and a page at a path prefix `ðŸ§° how-to`
will be rendered with color `#96020e`:

**V1:**
```yaml
# Graphview
graphview:
  ignoredPrefixes:
    - "Library/Core"
  default_color: "000000"
  colormap:
    path:
      services: "01017a"
      notes: "02bdb6"
      projects: "ffc533"
      how-to: "96020e"
    tag:
      garden: "0bbd02"
```

**V2:**
```yaml
config.set {
  plugs = {
    -- Add your plugs here 
    "ghr:deepkn/silverbullet-graphview",
    ...
  },
  ...
  graphview = {
    ignoredPrefixes = {
      "Library",
    },
    colormap = {
      tag = {
        services = "01017a",
        notes = "02bdb6",
        ...
      },
    },
  },
...
}
```

## Links

Click on the node labels to directly navigate to pages in your space

## Label-shortening

Long labels are shortened for readability. E.g.
`notesarecool/somethingverylong/subsubsubsub/foo` â†’ `notes./somet./subsu./foo`

## For offline development

To ease development of the visual part, the offline folder contains a copy of
the html and custom javascript. As well as a simple graph model.

```bash
$ cd offline
$ python -m http.server
```
